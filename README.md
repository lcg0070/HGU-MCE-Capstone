## Tutorial (For Software-based Topics) 

Generate 640 Ã— 640 images using the generation files (PCA and CUBE).
Then train using the HSI_cube and HSI_PCA files, save the resulting weights, and compare their performance.

### Requirements

To use the codes without errors, install the libraries listed in the Requirements.txt file. The codes require at least 1 GPU to run and handle the data.

### Dataset Details

The dataset includes:
- RGB images of 53 PCBs scanned with a high-resolution RGB camera (Teledyne Dalsa C4020).
- 53 hyperspectral data cubes of those PCBs scanned with Specim FX10 in the VNIR range.
- Two segmentation ground truth files: 'General' and 'Monoseg' for 4 classes of interest - 'others,' 'IC,' 'Capacitor,' and 'Connectors.'

### Data Access

To utilize the dataset, download it from the Rodare website: [Rodare](https://rodare.hzdr.de/record/2704), or from Zenodo: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10617721).
